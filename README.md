# BasicGUI

BasicGUI is a powerful tool that allows players to customize their GUI's according to their individual preferences. This mod provides a plethora of options that players can use to modify the appearance and layout of their GUI, making it both more functional and visually appealing.

Using BasicGUI, players can choose the size, color, and transparency of various GUI elements, such as the health and hunger bars, hotbar, inventory, and crafting interface. Additionally, players can adjust the position of these elements to create a custom layout that suits their gameplay style. This means that players who prefer a minimalist GUI can reduce the size of their inventory and move it to the corner of their screen, while players who frequently use the crafting interface can expand it and move it to a more central location.

BasicGUI also allows players to add and remove certain elements from their GUI. For example, players who find the debug information distracting can choose to hide it, while those who want to keep track of their coordinates and FPS can add these elements to their GUI.

BasicGUI also supports the creation and importing of custom GUI skins. Players can create personalized GUI designs using image editing software such as Photoshop and then import them into BasicGUI. This feature enables players to create unique and highly personalized GUIs that reflect their individual style.
